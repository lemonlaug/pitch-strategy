Pitching Strategy Analytics
===========================

Introduction to PitchFx
---------------------------

Using tracking equipment installed in every major leagues stadium, baseball is now able to provide incredibly detailed data on every single pitch thrown during the big league season.

A lot of the existing work has focused on understsanding the strike zone...

Pitching Strategy
---------------------------

In game seven of the world series, with the tying run on third base and two outs Salvador Perez faced Madison Bumgarner with the game on the line. Bumgarner threw six straight high fastballs out of the strikezone.

One underexplored application of PitchFx data is in trying to understand pitching strategy. Each at-bat is of course not only a sequence of independent pitches, but in fact a whole strategic game between pitcher and batter. Conventional wisdom says that pitchers are most effective when changing speeds, and forcing the hitter to change his eye level by working inside and outside, and up and down in the zone.

Both the pitcher and batter try to anticipate each others' expectations in order to guess (hitter) or defy expectations (pitcher) of their adversary. Because of this strategic element, the game theory is extremely rich, and pitchers and batters presumably exploit all kinds of information to try and gain an edge in this strategic battle. This information may include, previous at bats against a given adversary, previous pitches in the current at bat, the pitcher's strategy against other hitters.



What Else To Do
----------------------------

Strategy, is it the catcher or the pitcher?
Can we identify players who especially excel at strategy?
Can we identify matchups that are especially favorable for one side or another based on the strategy + abilities of the pitcher?
